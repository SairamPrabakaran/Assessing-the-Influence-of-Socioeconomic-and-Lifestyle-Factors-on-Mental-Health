Assessing the Influence of Socioeconomic and Lifestyle Factors on Mental Health: A Data-Driven Approach
üìç Project Summary
This dissertation investigates the influence of demographic, lifestyle, and socioeconomic factors on depression using a comprehensive dataset of 413,768 individuals. The project applies an end-to-end data analysis pipeline using Python to derive meaningful insights from structured health and demographic data. The primary goal is to identify patterns, trends, and statistically significant relationships that contribute to understanding the determinants of mental health, particularly depression.

Conducted as part of an MSc in Data Science and its Applications at the University of Essex, this research emphasizes descriptive and inferential statistical methods, combined with data visualization, to explore and explain the complex factors affecting mental well-being. The findings aim to support public health awareness, inform policy decisions, and provide a data-driven foundation for future mental health research.

üìä Methodology
1. Data Preparation
Cleaned and processed over 400,000 entries to ensure data integrity.

Encoded categorical variables, handled missing data, and filtered for relevant age groups (‚â•18 years).

2. Descriptive Statistics
Summary statistics were used to understand the central tendencies and distributions of key variables:

Age: Ranged from 18 to 98, with a mean of approximately 49 years.

Income: Displayed a wide range, capturing diverse socioeconomic statuses.

Number of Children: Modeled at one child per participant.

3. Data Visualization
Box plots illustrated the relationship between age and chronic medical conditions, revealing that older participants reported a greater number of health issues.

Correlation heatmaps highlighted moderate correlations, notably between age and the presence of chronic diseases.

Visual tools were used extensively to detect trends, outliers, and distributions across variables.

4. Statistical Testing
Chi-square tests identified significant associations between categorical variables such as marital status and depression.

T-tests revealed statistically significant differences in mean income levels between depressed and non-depressed groups, indicating a potential economic dimension to mental health outcomes.

üîç Key Findings
üìà Demographic Trends
Age: Depression prevalence increased notably in individuals aged 45 and above.

Marital Status: Higher depression rates were observed among divorced and widowed participants.

Education: An inverse relationship was identified, with higher educational attainment (e.g., postgraduate qualifications) associated with lower depression incidence.

üß¨ Lifestyle and Health Behaviors
Smoking and Alcohol Use: Associated with elevated depression levels, suggesting potential behavioral or self-medication patterns.

Physical Activity: Linked with lower reported depression symptoms, reinforcing its role as a protective factor.

Diet: Participants following a balanced diet (rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains) showed fewer depression symptoms compared to those consuming highly processed or sugar-rich foods.

üí∞ Socioeconomic Factors
Income: Individuals in lower income brackets exhibited higher rates of depression, likely influenced by financial instability and reduced healthcare access.

Economic Security: Appears to act as a buffer against mental health challenges, with higher income levels correlating with better mental well-being.

üéØ Project Objectives
Identify key demographic and lifestyle variables influencing mental health.

Use exploratory and inferential techniques to uncover meaningful patterns.

Support evidence-based recommendations for health practitioners and policy-makers.

Demonstrate the application of data science in public health domains.

‚úÖ Outcomes
Discovered statistically significant trends linking age, income, health habits, and educational attainment with depression symptoms.

Provided strong visual and statistical evidence to support hypotheses grounded in existing mental health literature.

Generated actionable insights that can inform preventive strategies, targeted interventions, and future academic research in the mental health field.

üåç Broader Impact
By leveraging large-scale, real-world data, this project contributes to a growing body of work focused on early detection and prevention of mental health issues. The insights generated serve as a foundation for developing data-informed public health initiatives, particularly aimed at high-risk groups based on age, income, and health behavior profiles. The project also exemplifies the power of diagnostic and exploratory analytics in uncovering patterns that may otherwise go unnoticed in traditional health assessments.
